    <p><img src="images/elephant.jpg">Welcome to my website, this is where I will be posting all of my work for my Computer Science Class. My name is Mohammad Naqvi, and I am in the AP Computer Science class at Gahr High School. Some things I like to do when I have free time is play basketball or hangout with my friends. Some things I am interested in include learing more math and learning more coding(building a website, programming, making apps, etc). </p>
